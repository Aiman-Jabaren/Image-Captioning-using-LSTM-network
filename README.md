# Image-Captioning-using-LSTM-network

In this project, we have implemented an image captioning algorthim.
We train three different models and save their weights: Vanilla RNN, LSTM and pretrained
run training
python train.py

After that we investigate and run tests while calculating the loss and 3 different bleu scores.
